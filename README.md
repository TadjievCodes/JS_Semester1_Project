Link to the Live Demo of the website Shopping Cart of Moser in vanilla JS  
https://moser-tadjiev.web.app/store.html

Another Fanshawe project and the main task was to create a shopping cart with Vanilla JavaScript with various validations before adding the items into the cart. Also possible to change the currencies from CAD to USD. Besides, you can add a review of the item. In the Home section, I used Flexbox and CSS Grid to display the items but later I decided to use the Bootstrap cards for the items in the Store section.
